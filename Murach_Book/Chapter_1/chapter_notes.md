# An introduction to Python Programming

## Introduction to Python

Python was developed in the 1960's by Guido van Rossum of the Netherlands. It was intended to be a
simple and intuitive language.

**Pro's of Python**
* Closer to plain English than many languages
* Easily learn most concepts and skill used in other languages
* Supports a wide range of applications
* *Open-source*

### Three types of Python applications

1. **Console Application** - Enter commands at the *command prompt* in the *console* that's
                             available from your operating system.
2. **GUI Application**     - Application that had a *graphical user interface*. Performs the same
                             tasks as a console application, but is more user-friendly.
3. **Web Application**     - Application called by a web browser that uses a server to process or
                             store data.

Can also be used as a *scripting language* to work with other software applications or to develop
system administration programs.

### How Python compiles and runs source code

**code editor** ->
**source code** (.py files) -> **Python Interpreter** -> **bytecode** -> **Python virtual machine** ->
**operating system**
