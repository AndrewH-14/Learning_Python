# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
# https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
num_years = 90 - int(age)
num_months = 12 * num_years
num_weeks = 52 * num_years
num_days = 365 * num_years

print(f"You have {num_days} days, {num_weeks} weeks, and {num_months} months left.")
