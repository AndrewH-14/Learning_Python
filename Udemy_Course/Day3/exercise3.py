# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice:

# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
#
# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
#
# **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100
#
# **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# If the year is evenly divisible by 4, it can potentially be a leap year
if 0 == (year % 4):
    # If the year is not evenly divisible by 100 then it is a leap year
    if 0 != (year % 100):
        print("Leap year.")
    # If the year is evenly divisible by 100 and evenly divisible by 400 then it is a leap year
    elif 0 == (year % 400):
        print("Leap year.")
    # Otherwise, the year is not a leap year
    else:
        print("Not leap year.")
else:
    print("Not leap year.")
